There are two types of phones - ios and android.

ios - iphones - by Apple Inc.
iOS (formerly iPhone OS) is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware. 
It is the operating system that presently powers many of the company's mobile devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. 
It is the second most popular mobile operating system globally after Android.

Android - Google and open source

Google's Android and Apple's iOS are operating systems used primarily in mobile technology, 
such as smartphones and tablets. Android, which is Linux-based and partly open source, is
more PC-like than iOS, in that its interface and basic features are generally more customizable 
from top to bottom. However, iOS' uniform design elements are sometimes seen as being more user-friendly.
