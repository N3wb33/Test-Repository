Google's Android and Apple's ios comparison
-------------------------------------------
Google's Android and Apple's iOS are operating systems used primarily in mobile technology, 
such as smartphones and tablets. Android, which is Linux-based and partly open source, is
more PC-like than iOS, in that its interface and basic features are generally more customizable 
from top to bottom. However, iOS' uniform design elements are sometimes seen as being more user-friendly.
